<p>Hello class, My name is Isaiah Smith, and I am an aspiring Data Engineer. I am a full time student at BMCC and also a full time worker. I love coding, its something i practice on my free time. I am almost fully certfied in Data Engineering through Coursera, so I've had my hand in code for some time. On my free time I love gaming, not so much when the school year is around as i dont have much free time, but I occassionaly get in a few rounds on Call of Duty. Im a big NBA fan, longtime fan of the great Kobe Bryant. As you can tell from the layout of this site, its Laker Colored!</p>
